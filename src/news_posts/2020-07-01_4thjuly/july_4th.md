Get ready to have a blast! If your neighbors aren't setting off enough fireworks each night at 10pm, and your Fourth plans look different than in years past. We have the answer....the Firecracker Chicken Panini. We'll be serving this all month along with the new Tropical Summer Smoothie.

We want to assure you that we are taking extra precautions to make sure we provide you a safe dining experience whether you dine in, utilize our outdoor seating, order takeout, order curbside pickup, or have us deliver straight to you. Our website allows you to order ahead so that your food is ready when you arrive. This helps us, help each of you, maintain social distancing when at the Cafe. Have a fun and safe Fourth...see you soon Elmira!
