WE WEREN'T SURE THAT WE WOULD BE DOING ANY MARKETS THIS SUMMER....

BUT HERE WE ARE.

Come join us along with our friends Haskins Gardens, Bespoke Apothecary, and Sunset View Creamery today, and every other Friday, in the Greenspace outback of Arnot Ogden Hospital. The Greenspace is the shaded courtyard on the corner or Roe & Ogden Ave. We will be setup from 11-2 serving Wraps, Salads, and Smoothies.

The market at Arnot is open to the public as well as anyone that is visiting the premise. We look forward to another great market season. Come join us every other Friday, all summer long!
