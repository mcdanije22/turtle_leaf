We want to take a moment to thank everyone that supported our POP UP at Horseheads Jubilee over the last 10 weeks. We owe a big thank you to Dave Marks and his entire staff who made some sacrifices to allow us the opportunity to run a secondary location in the midst of our COVID-19 shutdown.

Unfortunately our volume of sales recently hasn't been enough for us to continue operating out of Horseheads Jubilee. Our main location in Elmira is up and running, we will continue to run Mon-Sat from 9-2 for the time being. We will continue looking at ways we can get back into the Horseheads market over time.
